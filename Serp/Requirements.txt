Rule
    The rule interface consists of a square divided into 4 quadrants
    Each quadrant except the top left one is further divided into 4 subsquares
    The default rule is 0, 0, 0 -- This is represented by shading the top left subsquare of each quadrant 
    Different rules can be chosen by clicking unselected subsquares
    Only one subsquare can be selected per quadrant -- attempting to select an additional subsquare will result in deselecting the originally-selected subsquare
    The selection of a new subsquare automatically updates the fractal being displayed to use the newly-defined rule
    Below the square, the rule should be displayed as three text fields
        These fields automatically update when the rule changes by other means
        These fields only accept integers in the range [0, 3]

Depth
    The depth of the fractal should determine how many iterations of the current rule should be displayed
    Above the depth-manipulation UI elements, a label should exist that displays the current depth
    Depth will be user-modifiable through various means:
        Manipulation of a horizontal slider
        clicking '-' and '+' buttons positioned to the left and right of the slider, respectively
        Pressing two keyboard keys (for now, <- and ->)
        Positioning the mouse over the slider (or slider container, to increase leniency) and scrolling with the mouse wheel
            Scrolling up or down should increment or decrement the depth, respectively
            To decrease ambiguity of controls, the scroll wheel should have minimal functionality besides this use
        After holding a '+' or '-' button for [BUTTON_HOLD_THRESH] seconds, begin repeatedly activating the button at some frequency
            (Check typing behavior when holding a keyboard key down)
        Pressing the two keyboard keys should have identical functionality as the '+' and '-' buttons
    Depth should have maximum and minimum values 
    [MIN_DEPTH] should be 0, which shows a square with no quadrants taken out of it
    The difference in the fractal between [MAX_DEPTH] - 1 and [MAX_DEPTH] should be noticable
    [MAX_DEPTH] <= floor[log2[min(width, height)]]

Fractal
    Any area that cannot be part of the fractal should be filled with a relatively dark gray (e.g. #050505)
    Quadrants removed over the course of the fractal should be removed by drawing a Black square over them
    The fractal size should be X * min(width, height), 0.5 <= X <= 1
    As the window is resized, the fractal size should automatically update
    While the window is being resized and after the window has stopped changing size, the fractal should redraw itself every [FRAMES_TIL_FRACTAL_REDRAW_ON_RESIZE] frames (or every 60 / [FRAMES...] seconds)
    The user should be able to toggle animation of the fractal
        During animation, the fractal depth should increase until [MAX_DEPTH] is reached
        The user should be able to specify the speed of animation by selecting between 'slow', 'medium', and 'fast' animation speeds
        Once the fractal reaches [MAX_DEPTH], animation should pause for [MAX_DEPTH_PAUSE_TIME]
        Once the fractal reaches [MAX_DEPTH], one of three outcomes should occur:
            Depth is set back to [MIN_DEPTH] and animation continues
            Depth is animated decreasing from [MAX_DEPTH] to [MIN_DEPTH], and bounces between those values
            Animation stops
        The user should be able to select between these behaviors through a radio button

Any control when moused over for [TOOLTIP_MOUSEOVER_TIME] should display a tooltip at the position of the mouse
